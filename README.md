# FEWD-a01
FEWD assignment 1
## Greetings!

This is Christine from row 3. I learned a great deal in FEWD I and am looking forward to FEWD II. FEWD II will be especially challenging for me since pretty much all of the topics we are covering are completely new to me. 

### Hobbies/Interests

When I am not working or attending FEWD classes I enjoy: 
- reading
- studying languages, and 
- watching movies

Below is a frame from one of my favorite movies: ROLLERBALL (1975)
